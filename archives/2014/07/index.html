        <p>Thus ends week three of the Mongo course. I STILL haven’t had time to do much else, but in a couple of weeks I’m leaving on a trip where my internet access will be limited. I’m planning on spending a lot of time with the textbook and catching with pyORMatic then. I’ll try to make more advances over the coming weeks, as they ought to be less hectic than the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>This week in Mongo was about Schema design. More specifically, about how Schemaless design is “great.” I’ve ranted a little in last week’s post about this, but here’s some more:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is nice to have a rich document design that can have many layers. This reduces the number of documents/tables needed to store related information. As such, One-One and One-Many relations are modeled quite easily in Mongo, assuming the data being stored is only pertinent to the parent document.  </li>
<li>However, having such a rich document design has drawbacks, since it makes it difficult to have normalized data - that is, data that isn’t repeated or replicated. Ideally, if something needed changing, one would only need to change it in one location.</li>
<li>Furthermore, relations between tables have to be performed inside the programming language, rather than inside the database. There may be a way that I haven’t learned yet to do relations within Mongo, but what I have learned just feels very clunky.</li>
</ul>
<p>It felt like there were several workarounds that were needed to accurately model the relations. In the Mongo videos, the examples that they gave amounted to: “You would never actually need to do this with correct schema design”, or “We don’t need to store this data because it would contradict with our schema design”.</p>
<p>For the homework this week, I did write a couple of one liners in python that were pretty awesome. A little bit of an aside: Functional constructs in langauges are amazing. They allow code to be incredibly short and once one understands them, can pack a ton of power into a single line of code.</p>

        <p>This week, I’ve done the 2nd week of the MongoDB course. Thankfully, unlike last week, I managed to submit the homework on time. Mongo has been taking up a large majority of the time that I’ve been able to spend on the databases class, but hopefully, I’ll get to spend more time next week.</p>
<p>One of the things that I personally believe is valuable and increases the depth of knowledge out of a course is teaching others. I’ve been trying to be active on the MongoDB forums, answering questions that I have the ability to. At first, this was very difficult, but I’ve been able to do it more and more easily. It’s always nice to be thanked, as well.</p>
<p>The primary goal this week for the Mongo course was CRUD operations. One thing that I’m not a huge fan of is Mongo’s schemaless design. All of the operations feel fairly arbitrary and cobbled together. Also, though it is nice to have native extensions in the language that you are using, there are some annoyances. It’s difficult to translate database queries between languages, since they use the programming language’s design features. Thankfully, python has data structures that are more or less analogous to Javascript’s Object and Array types, but for a language like Java, C, or others, I imagine it’s much more difficult to wrap your head around.</p>
<p>As a result, even though Mongo has a rich querying langauge that’s pretty well represented by PyMongo, I still prefer to do the bare minimum with PyMongo, and perform all the sorting, limits, and manipulations within Python itself. I’ve been trying to force myself to do things with PyMongo as much as possible, but it leads to a lot of frustrated cries of <a href="http://gag.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/google/gag/annotation/remark/ThisWouldBeOneLineIn.html" target="_blank">“THIS COULD BE DONE IN ONE LINE!”</a></p>

        <p>This week I started the MongoDB university course. I actually started the Java course some time ago, but decided to hold off on that in favor of the Python course, a much more pleasant language to program in. Also, who can live without the Monty Python references?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I misread the submission due date for the 1st week’s homework as 5 o’clock PM PST, when it was actually 5 o’clock PM UTC. It’s entirely my fault, since I’ve been so used to everyone on the internet using Pacific time as the standard time (as it should be!). Regardless, it’s not all bad, and they drop the lowest week’s homework score, so as long as I do well the rest of the time, I shouldn’t have too much of an issue.</p>
<p>The first week was mostly about setting up mongo, Python, and an introduction to JSON. Since I was already well versed in JSON and Python, it was mostly review for me, though I did learn some interesting things about some of the advantages and drawbacks of the JSON syntax, as well as what exactly mongo was (I had assumed that it used the same structured query language as popular databases such as MySQL, Postgres, or Oracle used, only with some extensions). I was actually pleasantly surprised that Mongo’s shell was simply a javascript interpreter with a couple of custom built in functions. Being able to take advantage of such a rich programming language in executing queries in the mongo shell was quite nice.</p>
<p>However, initial impressions of Mongo have lead me to believe that it is rather clunky and clumsy. JSON is rather nice, but some of the syntaxes that Mongo uses for the conditions, sorting, limits, etc are unintuitive at best and require constant reference to documentation. The functions are not very descriptive, and to do something as simple as selecting all records from the database where the score is greater than a certain number requires several JSON objects, some of which are nested several layers deep.</p>
<p>One nice thing about Mongo is how fast it is - benchmarks have shown it to be much faster than any SQL database, so I have pretty high hopes for using Mongo for big data.</p>
<p>I’m not yet convinced about the merits of schemaless databases, but I’ll reserve judgement for now.</p>
