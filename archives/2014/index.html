        <p>F1 database is a distributed database developed by Google - more details here: <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/41344.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/41344.pdf</a></p>
<p>I’m going to do my best to explain my understanding of what the paper describes.</p>
<p>The premise of what Google was trying to do was create a RELATIONAL database designed to be distributed and highly available, unlike other relational databases such as MySQL which didn’t have quite as great of a distributed system. It was designed to be Scalable, consistent, and usable as a SQL database.</p>
<p>Some of the design choices that Google had made increased reading and writing latency due to extra safety and security of data, though application level programming reduced the hit to the user experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Servers are stateless - clients can connect to any server in the network and expect the same result</li>
<li>Queries can be executed parallelized and map-reduced,  and will transparently be determined if that will be beneficial.</li>
<li>Primary keys are designed such that queries can easily be run in parallel</li>
<li>Downtime is to be minimized</li>
<li>Multiple types of transactions to gaurentee consistency with data retrieved and committed.</li>
<li>Locking types are flexible</li>
<li>Logging is designed to be efficient and descriptive</li>
<li>Document based store is available along with relational stores</li>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In addition to my coursework in MongoDB, I decided to do some more research from someone who may not be as biased as 10gen (the developers of MongoDB).</p>
<p>Here are the two links I used:</p>
<p><a href="http://halls-of-valhalla.org/beta/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-mongodb,45/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://halls-of-valhalla.org/beta/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-mongodb,45/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/</a></p>
<p>(Now, granted, they may be biased against MongoDB, obviously the 2nd one, but we’ll see).</p>
<p>R.E. the first one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages:<ul>
<li>Load balancing and redundancies in MongoDB is far simpler than many SQL databases.</li>
<li>The document database system (instead of relational database system) means that the speed of MongoDB is far faster than anything a relational database system can achieve, if only because one query is often sufficient to obtain all or nearly all information.</li>
<li>MongoDB is flexible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages:<ul>
<li>Joins must be handled in the program, which can reduce code readability. Also, traditional optimizations  that databases can make for joins no longer exist in Mongo</li>
<li>MongoDB requires much more memory than relational databases</li>
<li>Denormalization is common in MongoDB. To normalize, sometimes storing references is required (in which case, why not just use a relational database in the first place?)</li>
<li>Though MongoDB’s actions are mostly atomic, it doesn’t have the same concept of ACID transactions that many relational databases have.</li>
<li>MongoDB is up and coming technology, as opposed to relational databases which are battle hardened.</li>
<li>Safe mode in mongodb is confusing - data sent to the database doesn’t ensure that data gets written to teh database</li>
<li>Transactions need to be manually emulated in code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first article claims that even though the cons list is long, there are some use cases for it.</p>
<p>Second article:</p>
<p>The author is a self-proclaimed expert on web applications who feels he made the wrong decision with MongoDB.</p>
<p>The project was a widely distributed social networking system that involved a lot of independent applications working together to provide a social networking experience. Many databases were asynchronously updating and had different contents, and would only fetch the ones they needed.</p>
<p>Mongo documents are great for self contained documents that have many separate components, but for social networking, some of the components end up being duplicated quite often. Social networking isn’t really self-contained either, which makes linking between them difficult.</p>
<p>Part of the issue the author ran into was that cache invalidation is rather difficult to implement when considering edge cases. MongoDB acts more like a cache than a database.</p>
<p>As a result, MongoDB’s use case is extremely narrow, according to the author, perhaps narrow enough to warrant ignoring or avoiding it alltogether. </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I cannot post the research paper that I’ve been involved with here, but here is a bit of a writeup about it:</p>
<p>There had already been a database system set up prior to me joining the project, so I was tasked with maintaining and preparing the database for publication, along with analytics and other minor things. We did run into some problems, namely that even though the original designers of the database schema attempted to anticipate the needs of the students for creating proper logs, due to the nature of how medical diagnoses and procedures go, students were forced to adapt in unfortunately inconsistant ways. A non-insignificant amount of the data would be skewed against certain types of diagnoses and procedures unless something was done.</p>
<p>My involvement was on the programatic side of things, to develop a solution to perform automated cleanup (i.e. typos or improper categorization) and facilitate manual cleanup when automatic cleanup was impossible (procedures/diagnoses missing/not present). One major problem that was run into was consistently deciding what diagnoses related to the often vague symptoms. This required us to improve the context available to the person making the judgments beyond what was immediately available, requiring complex joins, groups, and sometimes, queries from separate databases altogether.</p>
<p>The research is nearly done, but it tested the limits of what I knew about database administration and programming, and forced me to think in new and creative ways to implement what the others on the project required. </p>

        <p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Index access helps to reduce the amount of time required to search through a file - stores each value and a pointer to all disk blocks that include it.</li>
<li>Primary index used to physically order files on the disk</li>
<li>Clustering index - used if multiple indexes are suitable for physical ordering</li>
<li>Secondary - doesn’t deal with ordering of the file, but locates it.</li>
<li>Dense indexes have an index entry for every single search key</li>
<li>Sparse - only some of the search keys</li>
<li>Indexes are useful because they occupy a smaller portion of the disk than the data file - they include fewer records and they only have two fields, the key and the address of the block.</li>
<li>Clustering - takes up more room, but works on more complex files and indexes</li>
<li>Secondary index - allows other means of accessing data when a primary index already exists - must still be unique.<ul>
<li>Takes more storage space and a longer search time, but still improvement over no index at all.</li>
<li>For non-unqiue data, indexing is still possible, but makes searches more complicated, since the index has to store a list of pointers, instead of a single one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multilevel indexes<ul>
<li>Used to reduce the search space for a binary search</li>
<li>Uses multiple levels of indexes until the highest level can fit in a single block.</li>
<li>Can be used for any index, so long as there are distinct values for K(i)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Partitioned hashing - n components produce n hashes, which are catted together to produce one hash. Useful for equality, but not really for searching</li>
<li>B-tree and B+-tree<ul>
<li>Tree is formed of nodes, each node (except for the top node) has one parent and 0 or more children.</li>
<li>Trees are unbalanced</li>
<li>B-Trees<ul>
<li>Kept between 50-100% full</li>
<li>Searching works by forcing things to the left of the key to be left than it, and things to the right of the key to be greater than it. That way, when you compare the key you are looking for to the tree, you can easily find out which direction to travel.</li>
<li>Balancing a tree minimizes the number of levels</li>
<li>B-trees have additional constraints to make sure that they are always balanced</li>
<li>Each node of a b-tree has multiple bits of data and multiple tree pointers - the heirarchy of increasing value goes left to right - tree pointer, data pointer, tree pointer, data pointer, etc, etc, and finally a tree pointer.</li>
<li>If removal causes the node to be less than half full, it’s combined with neighboring nodes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B+-trees<ul>
<li>Like a b-tree, except each node only points to the node to the left most node at the next level, and the left node points to the node to the right, and so on</li>
<li>Insertions and deletions call for complicated algorithms, but they are computationally fast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grid files - multi-dimensional array. Works well for access time, but requires a lot of space and difficult to re-organize</li>
<li>Hash index - uses hashing other than the one used for primary index.</li>
<li>Bitmap indexes - index for one or more columns, and each value in the column is indexed.<ul>
<li>Built using one particular value and is an array of bits (sequential 1s and 0s referenceing whether or not something exists at that location).</li>
<li>Efficient in storage space, but difficult to maintain</li>
<li>Can use bitwise operations to maintain though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Function based indexing - applying a function on field(s) becomes the key to an index.</li>
<li>Logical vs Physical indexes<ul>
<li>Physical indexes have a block location and an offset that must be changed if the file location on the disk is changed</li>
<li>Logical indexes - let some other system handle where the files are, and use indexes to point to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most databases are stored somewhere in the file system (on magnetic or SSD storage).</li>
<li>They generally have algorithms to help accessibility, called indexes</li>
<li>Databases are too big to fit entirely into memory</li>
<li>Magnetic tape storage allows for a very cheap method of backing up data</li>
<li>File allocation is done in clusters, which are contigious bits of data that are linked (provide pointers to the next node). Indexes are also common.</li>
<li>File headers provide description about a file that tells the OS how to process it</li>
<li>File operations include retrieval and update operations - finding information or adding new information to a file.<ul>
<li>Searches can only be done by pattern matching, so complex queries need to be simplified to be able to work on the filesystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some files have ordered records, while others are nothing more than ‘heaps’. Inserting new records is efficient, but searching/location less so.</li>
<li>Sorted records take more time for inserts, but searching is much faster. Binary searches can be done easily (but require some sort of object that is sortable).</li>
<li>Hashing allows fast access under certain search conditions - a hash can yield the address where the file is stored - files are placed in buckets</li>
<li>RAID - use many disks to provide speed or redundency increases</li>
</ul>
<p>17.37. Can you think of techniques other than an unordered overflow file that can be used to make insertions in an ordered file more efficient?</p>
<p>Insertions can be made more efficient by keeping multiple ordered files, appending or prepending where appropriate, or if a record needs to be in the middle of the file, split it - rejoin it when there is downtime.</p>
<p>17.39. Can you think of techniques other than chaining to handle bucket overflow in external hashing?</p>
<p>Having nested hash buckets. </p>

<li>Natural joins (<code>*</code>) are equijoins that get rid of the 2nd set of attributes that represent a join</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The prior operations is a complete set - any other operation can be expressed as a series of the ones so far listed</li>
<li>Division operations are applied to two relations where one’s attributes are a subset of another -  get rid of a field that may include duplicate data that is irrelevant</li>
</ul>
<p>6.33. State whether the following conclusions are true or false:<br>a. NOT (P(x) OR Q(x)) → ( NOT (P(x)) AND ( NOT (Q(x)))<br>b. NOT (∃x) (P(x)) → ∀ x ( NOT (P(x))<br>c. (∃x) (P(x)) → ∀ x ((P(x))</p>

        <p>I managed to get quite a few book assignments done, as you can see. I believe I’m nearly done with the required amount of problems, though I’ll probably do quite a few more before I give up the ghost.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried to include notes on some later chapters, if I remember, I’ll try to go back and do notes for earlier chapters too. Hopefully, by the end of this week, I’ll have finished all the book chapters that I want to finish. I’m not going to be able to finish quite every chapter on my list, but I think I should get a pretty good sampling of what I want. I also need to put the finishing touches on pyORMatic, and polish everything up, and I should be good to go!</p>

        <p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL also has some advanced features beyond basic CRUD, like TRIGGERs and ASSERTIONs</li>
<li>SQL treats NULLs in a specific way regarding booleans - statements only return TRUE/FALSE if they are short-circuitable with the comparsion</li>
<li>SQL allows us to check for nulls by using ‘IS’ (like python!)</li>
<li>SQL allows sets and nested queries<ul>
<li>Keywords like ANY or ALL can be useful for nested queries and using comparison operators</li>
<li>Nested query scope is similar to programming languages - the scope refers to the innermost nested query</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exists - check to see if something is there<ul>
<li>Can be used with “EXCEPT” as well to provide conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distinct - for explicit sets</li>
<li>AS for renaming stuff</li>
<li>Joins…<ul>
<li>Default is inner</li>
<li>left and right are cool too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aggregation - similar to mongodb, grouping, count, sum, max, min, avg, etc.<ul>
<li>Having - groups with conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Triggers and assertions:<ul>
<li>Assertions for enforcing constraints (and preventing updates when something doesn’t meet them)</li>
<li>Triggers for creating actions when certain events occur, such as updates or deletes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Views<ul>
<li>Single table derived from other tables that can have queries executed on. Will always remain up to date.</li>
<li>View updating is complicated. It can generally be passed through, but not in certain conditions. Usually views are not updatable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Schema changes<ul>
<li>Dropping - can be done in a cascading or restricted fashion (cascading means dropping all references, restrict prevents dropping if any references exist)</li>
<li>Alter - add or remove columns, or change column properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL is a standard language that all implementations must follow.</li>
<li>SQL has several data types - numeric, character/string, bit-string, boolean, and date</li>
<li>Constraints can further limit the data input in a table, such as verifying the size of the data, setting default values, or preventing NULLs from occurring<ul>
<li>Constraints can be named</li>
<li>Constraints help enforce integrity of data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SQL has a retrieval statement called “SELECT”<ul>
<li>Usually paired with “FROM” and “WHERE”</li>
<li>Where clause limits the rows returned from the select statement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SQL has a pattern matching statment called “LIKE”</li>
</ul>
