So the last two weeks, I was on a cruise ship, in Alaska. Despite the remoteness of it, we still had surprisingly good cell service, so I managed to finish my MongoDB courses. Thankfully, I managed to finish with a 90%, with perfect homework scores, and unfortunately, I missed two questions on the final. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to carve out as much time as I thought I may be able to for the textbook or the data mining book that I meant to read/review, so over the next couple of weeks, that'll be my goal.

I'll probably put something up about a general overview of the mongo course eventually here, but this is a placeholder to fill space. I'm overall disappointed with the amount of work that I've been able to do, but I suppose that I did the best I could (can't ask for more really).
