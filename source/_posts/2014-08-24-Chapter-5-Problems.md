Notes:
* SQL also has some advanced features beyond basic CRUD, like TRIGGERs and ASSERTIONs
* SQL treats NULLs in a specific way regarding booleans - statements only return TRUE/FALSE if they are short-circuitable with the comparsion
* SQL allows us to check for nulls by using 'IS' (like python!)
* SQL allows sets and nested queries
  * Keywords like ANY or ALL can be useful for nested queries and using comparison operators
  * Nested query scope is similar to programming languages - the scope refers to the innermost nested query
