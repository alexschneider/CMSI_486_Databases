So keen followers of this blog may notice that Week Three is mysteriously missing from the list of blog posts. This was intentional, you see, because this is a computer science class. As such, computer scientists only know how to count in multiples of two, so this will be the only blog post until week 8 of the course <sup>not really</sup>.

What actually happened was far less exciting - I got rather sick over the past couple weeks, and in between work and trying to rest up, I was forced to abandon my academic pursuits. However, I'm now back! As a result of being off for so long, I'll attempt to make this post longer than normal. So last week, the class met for the 2<sup>nd</sup> time. We discussed our projects and what we had learned up to that point. One of the things we talked about were some of the difficulties with using flat files to store information in databases.

Flat files are a very simple method of storing data that involves the application using them directly writing data to and from the filesystem. In general, the programmer implements a flat file data store from scratch in his program, handling reading and writing by himself, in some sort of standard format. Flat file database stores suffer from a couple of issues:

* There's no concurrent access since opening a file handle places a file lock on it.
* Reading and writing from a file incurs a lot of overhead (This is alleviated by caching, but increases the complexity of a program)
* The program is in charge of file management and writing the files. Occasionally there are libraries that help with this, such as INI or CSV libraries.
